# üõ°Ô∏è SMARTFENCE ‚Äì Intruder Prevention Warning System (IPWS)

A smart, IoT-based security system that integrates motion sensing, video surveillance, and adaptive electric fencing to detect and respond to unauthorized intrusions in real time.



## üìñ Abstract

This project designs an integrated **Intruder Prevention Warning System (IPWS)** combining physical barriers, motion detection, video surveillance, and wireless alert mechanisms. It uses a **PIR sensor**, **ESP32-CAM**, **OpenCV**, and **Telegram bot integration** for real-time alerting and action. The fencing is activated with variable voltage based on the size/type of intruder and can be deactivated via user feedback.

**Key Features:**
- Motion detection with PIR sensor
- Real-time video capture and analysis
- Telegram-based alerting system
- Intelligent fencing activation based on intruder size
- Servo motor-based gate access
- User feedback-based override mechanism

## üîß Working & Implementation

### 1. PIR Motion Detection
Detects infrared radiation from moving objects and signals ESP32-CAM on motion.

### 2. Data Transmission via ESP32-CAM
Captures image/video and processes locally using OpenCV.

### 3. Image Analysis using OpenCV
Classifies the intruder (human/animal/object) to decide fencing voltage.

### 4. Alert via Telegram
Sends image and classification alert to the user via Telegram bot.

### 5. Electric Fencing Activation
- Big Intruder: 3.3V  
- Small Intruder: 2.5V  
- Human: 1.5V  

### 6. Fencing Deactivation
Deactivates fencing automatically after intruder leaves.

### 7. User Feedback
User can reply "friend" to deactivate fencing and open gate via servo.

### 8. Servo-Controlled Gate
Opens/closes gate upon user authorization.

### 9. Continuous Monitoring
System loops in low-power mode and activates only when needed.




## üîÆ Future Upgradations

- ‚úÖ Replace ESP32-CAM with **Raspberry Pi** for faster processing.
- ‚úÖ Use higher resolution **camera modules**.
- ‚úÖ Implement **segment-wise fencing voltage control**.
- ‚úÖ Add **audible buzzer alert** for real-time intruder warning.
